Mesh Example
============
This code (`main.cpp`, `ofApp.cpp` and `ofApp.h`) needs to be put into an OF app
and then compiled. It demonstrates basic ofMesh usage, drawing 3D objects.

How GL works
------------
The following link introduces the concept of the camera, nodes, meshes etc. Note
that it is not neccessary to understand every detail here - this is for reference
and for a general understanding of how a 3D scene is represented in OpenFrameworks.
