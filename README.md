Creative Coding
---------------

This repository is to assist in teaching OpenFrameworks. It contains example
projects for OpenFrameworks.

Usage
-----
This repository does not include openframeworks: instead, to compile the code
a stub header providing only the essential OpenFrameworks API is provided. The 
makefiles in a project directory include the "fake" `ofMain.h` instead of the
real one. 

The mock header allows compiling simple example code using 
[online compilers](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp_online.php) to demo
code where the full OpenFrameworks runtime is not available.

This repo is mostly online for my own reference, however if you wish to get
